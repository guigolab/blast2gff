README for blast2gff - Enrique Blanco 2001

1. blast2gff:

blast2gff is a program to compute series of Similarity_to_protein regions from one given set of
HSPs (BlastX). The basic idea is the projection of HSPs over one imaginary axis in order to
choose for each coordinate, the highest score among every HSP which overlaps that position. This
information might be useful in gene predictions to force some regions to be selected by the
genefinding programs such as in GeneID.

------------------------------------

2. Format files:

HSPs can be read from input files by reading two different formats:

* blast2hsp_format: This is one script by Roderic which reads the Blast output and translates (extract) into
its own format only the HSPs information:

BLASTX sw 1927 1968 - 2 38 17.5 2.2 0.88 42 57 MT_CHAAC 12 25 X 0 60  >MT_CHAAC METALLOTHIONEIN (MT). Length = 60
BLASTX sw 1332 1361 - 3 50 23.0 2.2 0.88 70 70 MT_TREBE 32 41 X 0 60  >MT_TREBE METALLOTHIONEIN (MT). Length = 60
BLASTX sw 1323 1370 - 3 46 21.2 7.2 1.0 43 43 MT_TREBE 25 40 X 0 60  >MT_TREBE METALLOTHIONEIN (MT). Length = 60 

* gff format:

NONAME     BLASTX.sw  hsp             5315      5512    0.980  +  2  MIM1_CHICK
NONAME     BLASTX.sw  hsp             3068      3244    1.000  +  2  MIM1_CHICK
NONAME     BLASTX.sw  hsp             4611      4784    0.930  +  3  MIM1_CHICK
NONAME     BLASTX.sw  hsp             2409      2564    1.000  +  3  MIM1_CHICK      

blast2gff is able to translate HSPs from "blast2hsp_format" into "gff-format" by using the option -G.

------------------------------------

3. Options:

* "g": Blast2hsp_format is default format input, but it can be changed with this option to read HSPs in gff format.

* "G": Translate HSPs from Blast2hsp_format into gff format, printing them by the standard output. 

* "o": Don't execute the projection -> SRs are not wanted.

NAME
        blast2gff - A program to build similarity regions from blastx outputs
SYNOPSIS
        blast2gff <HSP_file>   

Setup Options:
        -g: Input HSP in GFF format
        -G: Print HSP in GFF format
        -o: Not SR construction      

------------------------------------

4. Output (SRs):

CHKMIM1    BLASTX.sw  sr               713       757    1.000  +  2  
CHKMIM1    BLASTX.sw  sr              1276      1446    0.870  +  1  
CHKMIM1    BLASTX.sw  sr              1447      1473    0.720  +  1  
CHKMIM1    BLASTX.sw  sr              1474      1488    0.480  +  1  
CHKMIM1    BLASTX.sw  sr              2409      2564    1.000  +  3  
CHKMIM1    BLASTX.sw  sr              3068      3244    1.000  +  2  
...

SRs have several special features due to their building method they don't overlap, they are actually divided into 6 axis, each
one is one strand and frame, their frames are {1,2,3} being frame 3 the same as frame 0 in geneid.

5. Piece of advice:

blast2gff is based on a Roderic's set of old scripts within which there were several routines such as the own blast2gff, blast2hsp
and others (see directory scripts). "blast2hsp" is the script used to translate HSPs from blast format into the format called
here "blast2hsp". This routine HAS NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED in blast2gff so several options are recommended to extract HSPs from
blast:

* the old script blast2hsp is very easy to use but is little flexible.
* parseblast by Pep Abril is one nice parser to extract a lot of features from blast standard output but is more complex to use.

6. Directories:

include: headers
objects: place for obj. files
src: source code
scripts: old scripts which made up the old blast2gff
samples: input and output files for one simple example -> S.blstx  S.gff  S.hsp  S.sr
